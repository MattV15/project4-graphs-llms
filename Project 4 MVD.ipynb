It\\'s college football. Students tend not to tailgate because its expensive as a student if your parents aren\\'t paying, but as adults with adult income, all of you chipping in some money to tailgate shouldn\\'t be much of an issue. In reality, it probably costs a similar amount of money to send bars vs tailgate, but students are much happier spending that money purely on booze than on a tailgating setup lol. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nParking is $25 day of (might be $20 if you prepay, but I\\'ve never done it so idk how it works). If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs far as places to go, Green Street is great for students, but options are more limited for adults (most adults don\\'t want to go to a club-esque college bar and eat drunk student food after a game lol). The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy\\'s. They\\'re both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at. There\\'s a lot of good ones from Blackdog. Guidos, Esquire Lounge, etc. Plus I think 1-2 breweries are in there as well if you\\'re into that. Never been to them tho.

Comparing a bus to an ebike would of course be ludicrous, but how about lifetime cost per user-trip for an MTD bus vs an equivalent number of user-trips for an escooter? Doubt you could find that data, but I imagine (because of economies of scale) the cost\\\\/benefit would be heavily weighted toward the bus as an inherently more efficient form of people mover at scale. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd I do agree that people need to pick these up, but I disagree that these \\'services\\' are a public good, which is what you\\'re implying. They are profit-making enterprises, and nothing more, and any public support of them should be minimized so they survive (or fail) entirely on their own merits (and so public support can be provided where it\\'s more appropriate - to publicly provided services like a mass-transit district).\",\"user\":\"Hairy-Dumpling\",\"com_votes\":10},{\"Unnamed: 0\":547,\"date\":\"2024-09-02 11:57:26\",\"post_votes\":286,\"text\":\"Veoride is $5 per month, and you can use it as much as you want in that month?

Just pick one.**\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe CS department\\\\u2014excuse me, the *Siebel School for Computing and Data Science*\\\\u2014gets more than 2000 applications a year for *each* of our graduate programs.  It\\'s unlikely that anyone would notice if you applied to one program, *got rejected*, and then applied for another, but in principle, that information is visible to the admissions committee and CS faculty who know where to look.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI\\'m not certain what would happen in if you were *accepted* for spring admission to MCS and then applied for MSCS admission in the fall, but **my best guess is that your MSCS application would be automatically rejected**.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one CS graduate program *at the same time.*  If you did submit simultaneous MCS and MSCS applications,  your MSCS application would be automatically rejected, and possibly your MCS applciation as well.  Similarly, if you already have a master\\'s degree in CS or a nearby field, you can\\'t be admitted to another master\\'s degree program in CS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut like I said, I\\'m not certain whether your plan is allowed.  You really should ask someone in the [CS graduate advising office](https:\\\\/\\\\/siebelschool.illinois.edu\\\\/academics\\\\/graduate\\\\/graduate-forms-advising-resources\\\\/graduate-advising-contacts).  Don\\'t just take my pessimistic word for it!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRegardless of what they tell you, my recommentation is that you decide which master\\'s degree you actually want, *and then apply only to that one*; don\\'t waste your time, or the admissions committee\\'s time, by applying to both.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* If you want to do reserach, apply for MSCS (but remember that you won\\'t be admitted unless at least one professor declares that they\\'re willing to be your advisor).\\\\r\\\\n* If you don\\'t want to do research (or you can\\'t identify a likely advisor) then apply for MCS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEither way, you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities, so that all your eggs aren\\'t in one basket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo answer your final question: Yes, applications to MCS and MSCS both require three recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, and a complete set of transcripts.  Admission to the MCS program is based primarily on grades, as long as you have a decent computer science background.  Admission to the MS program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters.\",\"user\":\"jeffgerickson\",\"com_votes\":1},{\"Unnamed: 0\":900,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 23:14:15\",\"post_votes\":0,\"text\":\"Everyone I know got an A+ last semester.\",\"user\":\"uofithrway\",\"com_votes\":1},{\"Unnamed: 0\":901,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 23:01:33\",\"post_votes\":4,\"text\":\"Is this a rick roll\",\"user\":\"Powerful-Raccoon3768\",\"com_votes\":2},{\"Unnamed: 0\":902,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 23:01:33\",\"post_votes\":4,\"text\":\"It was not\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis is good\",\"user\":\"Powerful-Raccoon3768\",\"com_votes\":2},{\"Unnamed: 0\":903,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 23:01:33\",\"post_votes\":4,\"text\":\"Super cool!!\",\"user\":\"UIUCTalkshow\",\"com_votes\":-1},{\"Unnamed: 0\":904,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 23:01:33\",\"post_votes\":4,\"text\":\"I know right?!\",\"user\":\"coherenteditor\",\"com_votes\":0},{\"Unnamed: 0\":905,\"date\":\"2024-08-31 22:21:14\",\"post_votes\":2,\"text\":\"I cant dm but i have the 3rd edition.

The bat wants to get outside and is flying around trying to find an exit. They can sense the outside air and will leave. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBats cannot fly for very long. They will land on a vertical surface like drapery or blinds. In both instances in my home they were brown bats and they clung to a dark brown fabric strip on the blinds. They can be very hard to spot. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMost likely the bat is still in your apartment unless there was an open door or window. They don\\\\u2019t seem very good at returning through the small entrances they used to get into the house. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBats are dangerous because of rabies. You can contract rabies even through minor contact with a bat (a scratch is sufficient, doesn\\\\u2019t have to be a bite). Untreated rabies in humans is nearly always fatal. You may want to go to student health services just in case. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in. Even if you toss it out, it may try to regain access via the same method it originally entered (if the bats are nesting in an attic or crawl space adjacent to your apartment).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI would not let the landlord blow off the situation.\",\"user\":\"Commercial_Stress\",\"com_votes\":3},{\"Unnamed: 0\":1324,\"date\":\"2024-08-30 09:20:44\",\"post_votes\":49,\"text\":\"We used to regularly get bats in our house in Champaign.

Study groups (not sure why your classmates are not good from your perspective) are often a way to meet people repeatedly and there by sometimes meet people they know. RSOs are the other place where shared interests provide a basis for developing longer term connections. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nyou evidently have an apartment and as such you are able to invite people over for study or project meetings or pot lucks or game nights what ever. Best way to convince people you are interested in making connections is to invest in them. Invite the to something. It\\\\u2019s work because everybody is pretty busy. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\na final suggestion is join a volunteer group doing something in town or on campus. Again a shared area of interest.\",\"user\":\"old-uiuc-pictures\",\"com_votes\":3},{\"Unnamed: 0\":1933,\"date\":\"2024-08-29 01:11:29\",\"post_votes\":1,\"text\":\"I got a job\",\"user\":\"doctor_subaru\",\"com_votes\":1},{\"Unnamed: 0\":1934,\"date\":\"2024-08-29 01:11:29\",\"post_votes\":1,\"text\":\"Go to transfer Tuesdays or the other ita events.

They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management\\\\/referral service.

Women\\\\u2019s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women\\\\u2019s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don\\\\u2019t necessarily think it\\\\u2019s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we\\\\u2019re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let\\\\u2019s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don\\\\u2019t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let\\\\u2019s say 2\\\\/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1\\\\/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS\\\\u2019s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don\\\\u2019t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I\\\\u2019ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I\\\\u2019ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women\\\\u2019s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I\\\\u2019d gotten more involved with them sooner. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI will also say as a final note that I can\\\\u2019t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn\\\\u2019t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I\\\\u2019ve seen over time, I wouldn\\\\u2019t trade the effort I\\\\u2019ve put into either of them for the world.\",\"user\":\"lukewarmdaisies\",\"com_votes\":41},{\"Unnamed: 0\":2978,\"date\":\"2024-08-26 07:49:26\",\"post_votes\":64,\"text\":\"If you want to join a women-focused RSO to learn more skills, join SWE or AOE (i can\\\\u2019t speak for AOE other than the women who I knew who joined it are awesome but SWE is very social but also has things like mock interviews, resume reviews, etc).

We went to a nearby ATM and before I gave her the money she wrote me a check. Little did I know, that you could verify if a check is valid or if the amount on the check would bounce just by calling the customer service number on the back of the check. I accepted the check and went on the train home. I knew in my gut something was wrong and that the check was fake, but I decided to ignore my gut feeling because I really wanted to help her out and even if I was getting scammed, I was fine with losing the $300, because I was going to make a lot more the next morning because I had a hobby that was paying well at the time.

It\\'s easier to tune the settings than a NOAA radio, so that you get only important warnings.  Many people react to being woken up by junk warnings (out of area, amber alerts, etc) by disabling the warnings entirely.   Also, most younger folks are surgically connected to their phone, but no one carries their NOAA radio to class or on a trip.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAll of the cell phone warnings are super loud.    You can select which warnings to receive, but the ones you allow bypass all sorts of loudness and \\\\\"do not disturb\\\\\" settings.    They aren\\'t quite as bad as some NOAA radios, but those will reliably wake the dead.\",\"user\":\"margaretmfleck\",\"com_votes\":1},{\"Unnamed: 0\":4224,\"date\":\"2024-08-23 04:58:21\",\"post_votes\":0,\"text\":\"I get what you are saying and don\\'t disagree, generally speaking, but the small topographic changes west of town seem to impact weather patterns.

The composition and overall mood are gentle and sweet. The image could be used for a variety of purposes, including marketing materials for baby products or as a family portrait.\n",

      "**Description:** The image shows Julie Bowen from the chest up, against a blurred background featuring a large \"M\" and what appears to be an award show backdrop.  She has shoulder-length, blonde, wavy hair styled with a side part. Her hair has some texture and volume.  Her makeup is relatively natural and enhances her features.  She is wearing a simple, light-colored, sleeveless top.  Her expression is pleasant and approachable; she appears to be smiling subtly. The overall impression is one of elegance and casual sophistication. The image is likely a publicity still or a photograph from an event.\n",
